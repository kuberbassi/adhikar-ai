## 📖 What is Adhikar.ai?

Most Indians fear the law because it's expensive and wrapped in jargon. **Adhikar.ai** democratizes justice by bridging the gap between a citizen's complaint and a lawyer's expertise. 

Using **Llama 3.3 70B**, Adhikar.ai analyzes natural language grievances, identifies the specific violation within the **Indian Penal Code (IPC)** or **Consumer Protection Act**, and drafts a professional, court-ready legal notice in seconds.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🤖 **Deep Legal Analysis** — Powered by Llama 3.3 (70B), identifying Acts, Sections, and Severity.
- 📄 **Instant Drafting** — Professional legal notices formatted with auto-populated dates, addresses, and citations.
- 📚 **Legal Database** — Searchable repository of Indian laws (Consumer, Rental, Employment, Fraud, etc.).
- 📁 **Evidence Vault** — Upload and preview evidence (PDFs/Images) alongside your claim.
- 🎨 **Premium Experience** — Modern glassmorphism UI built with **Tailwind CSS v4** and **Framer Motion**.
- 📱 **Mobile First** — Responsive design for access from any device, anywhere.

## ⚡ The Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |

| **IDE** | **Trae IDE** (AI-Native Development) ⚡ |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4 |

## 🛠️ The "Trae" Advantage (Hackathon Prize Category)

This project was built from scratch in a 48-hour sprint using **Trae IDE**. Trae's AI-native capabilities allowed our team to:
- **Accelerate Legal Mapping:** Use Trae's context-aware intelligence to structure complex Indian legal codes into a searchable JSON database.
- **Vite/Tailwind v4 Migration:** Trae handled the bleeding-edge configuration of the new Tailwind v4 engine without breaking legacy components.
- **Speed to Market:** The AI pair-programming features reduced boilerplate coding by an estimated **85%**, allowing us to focus on the legal drafting logic and user experience.
